I began my journey as a writer, a passion I cultivated for over ten years. However, it was the challenge of selling my own books that pushed me to constantly seek new tools, learn independently, and find creative solutions. Along the way, I taught myself how to build websites, explore different sales channels, analyze which social media platforms worked best, and refine my strategy to reach more readers. That led to thousands of sales and, more importantly, revealed a deep interest in technology and problem-solving.

That experience opened the door to the cloud and software development world, where I now apply the same mindset to build full-stack applications, work with AWS services, and keep learning every day.

While I’m used to working independently, I’m very collaborative by nature and always strive to contribute my best to the team. I consider myself calm, patient, and a good listener. I may not be the fastest learner, but I’m persistent and committed—when something catches my interest, I stick with it until I figure it out.

I'm currently open to entry-level roles where I can continue to learn, grow, and gain hands-on experience in the field.
